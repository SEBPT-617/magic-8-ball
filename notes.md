--- What is middleware? ---

- Middleware is a function that has access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
- Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined in the application. They are the building blocks that help you structure and manage your application logic, handling everything from authentication and logging to error handling and more.
  - These functions can perform a variety of tasks, such as:
    - Modifying the request or response objects.
    - Ending the request-response cycle.
    - Passing control to the next middleware function in the stack.

--- What is morgan? ---

- Morgan is a popular logging middleware for Node.js and Express applications.
- Its primary purpose is to log HTTP requests in a standardized format, making it easier to monitor and debug your application.
- Morgan can be configured to log various details about each request, such as the request method, URL, response status code, and response time.
